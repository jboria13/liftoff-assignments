## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am creating an app to track the price of groceries and help users find the lowest prices in their area. Users would login and upload the items they purchased, the prices, the date, and the store. Users will be able to track changes in prices over time on individual items. Users will also be able to create their shopping list and have an estimate of their sub total based on the gathered data. 

This app will help users stay organized when shopping and help users manage their grocery budget.  

### Features
User Account: Users will create accounts and use their accounts to upload items to the database. Users will have a profile page to view uploads and previous shopping lists they created.

Google Map Integration: Will allow users to see the prices for stores close to them.

Search: Users will search for items to check prices.

Shopping Lists: Users can put together store specific shopping list based off of items in the database. 

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
